Coursera Data Science Specialization. Module 3 Course Project
Submission by Tomaz Rodrigues in January 2025
The goal of this project is to write an R code file that downloads a set of motion data and turns it from 
a difficult to interpret mess into tidy data. This is accomplished by combining the multiple tables, renaming variables
and ultimately generating summary data

Files
run_analysis.R - R code to accomplish stated purpose
codebook.MD - describes the purpose of the R code
tidyData.txt - generated tidied up data that is mostly human interpretable
summaryData.txt - generated data that summarizes means for each activity seperated by test subject
